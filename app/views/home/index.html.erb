    Draft Tool is an online, interactive cheat sheet for your fantasy football draft.
    We supply the players and their stats, and you customize it. Define your league scoring
    and mark players you have picked, someone else has picked, or maybe you just want to
    keep an eye on. We also keep track of your projected points per game to help you analyze
    how well the draft is going for you. Draft Tool makes your draft day easier!
