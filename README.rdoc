== Draft Tool

Use this tool during your fantasy football draft.

= TODO:

Use tabs (js from bootstrap) to show players by position
Sort players (default => rank)
Mark players as drafted by someone else (highlight red)
Mark players to keep an eye on them (highlight green)
Show expected point total by position for selected players
Come up with a better way to update the stats (nokogiri?)
